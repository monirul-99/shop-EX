        "comments": "Netflix has a wide selection of movies, tv shows, and short series in many different genres and from various countries. I love the new and old films available on this app. Plus, Netflix makes their own great films. My favorite part is that you pay a monthly subscription and that's it; no in-app sales and no advertisements. Nice and simple, no chance for accidental subscriptions, and no extra costs. Hope they keep it this way. Thanks Netflix for this user friendly, well-organized streaming app."

        "comments": "I've had Netflix for years and there are so many movies I've wanted to see but it's not in English, with no option of English being translated, I have to read the entire movie. You then had the audacity to up the price when there are still movies I can only see if I read for an hour or two. Yes I've done it, but I don't want that to be my only option on an app I pay for. And there are barely any updated movies/shows. This is my last month paying for Netflix."

The only solution is to either close the app and reopen or skip forward to a point the video continues. App is currently updated to most current update. Not sure the issue but hope it will be fixed soon"
